					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Global warming is the term used to describe the rising of the
							average global temperature of the Earth that started in the
							pre-Industrial era due to the heating of the Earth’s surface.
							The Earth’s warming trend has been going on for a very long
							time, but the rate of warming has significantly increased in the
							last century mainly due to human activities. Human activities
							such as burning of fossil fuels to generate power and
							manufacture goods are causing worldwide temperatures to rise
							higher and faster than any time we know of in the past.

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							The main factor contributing to climate change is human
							activities. This is because of the large number of greenhouse
							gases we produce due to our lifestyle choices. Some greenhouse
							gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and play a part in
							making our planet habitable. However, the large number of
							greenhouse gases we produce is too much for the environment to

						<p>
							Warmer temperatures are gradually changing weather patterns and
							disrupting the normal balance of nature. Some of these changes
							such as heat waves, wildfires, prolonged drought, and extreme
							rainfall are happening faster than scientists previously
							predicted resulting in loss of lives, property damage and
							population displacement. Extreme weather and climate change pose
							many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.

						<h3><b>WHY SHOULD WE CARE?</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Although climate change is affecting everyone, the concern is
							its effects on future generations especially children and young
							people in Africa who will most likely bear the brunt in the
							coming decades. Scientists estimate that the worst is yet to
							come and predict a warmer atmosphere and ocean if we do not
							reduce emissions. If global warming is not stopped or slowed
							down now, world economies could become stagnant as governments
							and investors divert funding from critical services such as
							health, education, nutrition, and other social services which
							would yield benefits for future generations to mitigate the
							climate crisis.

						<h3><b>WHAT IS A CARBON FOOTPRINT?</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Carbon Footprint is defined as a measure of the total amount of
							greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere because of
							the activities of an individual, company or community.
							Greenhouse gases are making our planet warmer and causing
							climate change. Your personal carbon footprint includes
							emissions from a variety of sources such as your daily commute,
							the food you eat, the clothes you buy, everything you throw away
							... and more. The larger the carbon footprint, the heavier the
							impact on the environment.

						<h3><b>REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Everything we produce, buy, or use affects the environment. This
							environmental impact could be positive or negative.
							Unfortunately, most of the products we use negatively impact the
							environment through their production and usage and could harm
							the environment even further through improper disposal. For
							example, some of the products we use are made from plastics
							(takes between 20 - 500 years to decompose depending on
							structure) which often ends up in the landfill where they are
							burnt releasing CO2 to the atmosphere or ends up in our oceans
							negatively impacting sea life. We need to think about the
							environmental impact of the products we use and buy less of
							those that have a high negative impact. One way to think about
							the things we use is to look at the 3 Rs of managing waste:
							REDUCE, REUSE, RECYLE.

						<h3><b>THE FUTURE: CLEANER ENERGY FOR MANKIND</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							There is a subtle difference between these two energy types even
							though they are often spoken of as being the same. Renewable
							energy is power generated from sources that are constantly being
							replenished. These renewable energy resources won’t run out,
							unlike fossil fuels and gas, and include wind and solar energy.
							However, while most green energy sources are renewable, not all
							renewable energy sources are seen as being green. For example,
							hydropower is a renewable resource, but some would argue that it
							is not green, since the deforestation and industrialization
							related to the building of hydro dams can damage the
							environment. The perfect clean energy mix occurs where green
							energy meets renewable energy, such as with solar energy and
							wind energy.
