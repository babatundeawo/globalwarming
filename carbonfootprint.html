						<h3><b>WHAT IS A CARBON FOOTPRINT?</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Carbon Footprint is defined as a measure of the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions
							released into the atmosphere because of the activities of an individual, company or
							community. Greenhouse gases are making our planet warmer and causing climate change. Your
							personal carbon footprint includes emissions from a variety of sources such as your daily
							commute, the food you eat, the clothes you buy, everything you throw away ... and more. The
							larger the carbon footprint, the heavier the impact on the environment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Buildings, corporations, and countries have carbon footprints too. Carbon footprint includes
							direct emissions, such as those that result from fossil-fuel combustion in manufacturing,
							heating, and transportation, as well as emissions required to produce the electricity
							associated with goods and services consumed. A school’s carbon footprint is estimated based
							on the amount of electricity it uses, the school meals eaten by the students, and the items
							used like paper and pens.
						</p>
						<p>
							Any process or activity that creates greenhouse gases is included in the calculation of
							carbon footprint. For example, a pencil manufactured in a fossil fuel burning factory has a
							carbon footprint even though we are oblivious to the fact that fossil fuel was used during
							the manufacturing. The same is true for food, - a plate of vegetable salad might seem to
							have no carbon footprint however, fossil fuel is used to transport the vegetables from the
							farm to the shop.

						<h3><b>WHAT INCREASES OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT?</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Our lifestyle choices have a direct impact on our carbon footprints. A person’s carbon
							footprint is the combined total of the products they buy and use, the activities they
							undertake, and so on. Our footprints increase with our food and electricity consumption,
							transport usage, heating, and cooling requirements etc. Some of the foods that produce the
							largest amount of CO2 are beef, cheese, and poultry. Beef is very carbon polluting, but it
							also depends on the distance from farm to the location of consumption. The farther the
							distance, the higher the emissions from transportation.
						</p>
						<p>A person who regularly eats beef will have a larger food footprint than his vegan neighbour.
							However, the vegan neighbour’s overall footprint may be larger if he drives an hour to work
							and back in a truck everyday while the beef-eater walks to his office near his house. Their
							footprints will pale in comparison to the banker on the other side of town, who flies
							first-class cross-country once a month. In general terms the size of a person’s carbon
							footprint tends to increase with wealth.</p>
						<p>
							There are many ways for an individual, corporations and communities to reduce their carbon
							footprint. The first step is to measure or come up with a fairly accurate carbon footprint
							estimate and then take actions to reduce it. Some online carbon footprint calculators are:
						</p>

									Conservancy</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://offset.climateneutralnow.org/footprintcalc">United Nations</a></li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>You will be asked to provide pieces of information such as: how you commute to work, your
							usual diet, how often you drive or fly, your household size, type of electricity the grid
							provides to you etc.</p>

						<h3><b>WHAT ARE THE WAYS TO REDUCE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT?</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Carbon footprints can be reduced by making “greener” lifestyle choices, changing
							purchasing/buying habits, and improving energy usage/efficiency. Switching transportation
							and energy use can have a direct impact on primary carbon footprints – Cycling or use of
							public transportation such as buses and trains, reduces an individual’s carbon footprint
							when compared with driving. Installing energy-efficient lighting, adding insulation in
							buildings, or using renewable energy sources to generate electricity can reduce the
							respective carbon footprints of individuals and corporations – Solar or wind power to
							generate electricity produces no direct carbon emissions. Individuals can reduce their
							secondary carbon footprint through lifestyle choices – Decreasing beef consumption and
							switching to products that require fewer carbon emissions to produce and transport.
						</p>
						<p>Since there are myriads of ways to increase our carbon footprint, there are also several ways
							individuals especially children can reduce their carbon footprint and protect the
							environment. Some of the ways are:</p>
						<p>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Make “green” choices</b> – Recycle, Reuse and Reduce to reduce pollution and waste.
							</li>
							<li><b>Say “No” to single-use plastics</b> – Use only reusable items such as water bottles,
								utensils, bags etc. Many of these single-use plastics end up in landfills and pollute
								the oceans.</li>
							<li><b>Find ways to use less electricity</b> – Turn off lights in the bedroom, bathroom,
								living room and classroom when it is not required or there is no one there; Use only
								energy efficient bulbs; Do not leave the oven on for an hour before putting in your
								pizza etc. The good thing about electricity is one day, it might all be made from solar
								and wind power.</li>
							<li><b>Use less fossil fuel</b> – Walk or cycle to school instead of driving a vehicle that
								uses fossil fuels. That will keep you healthy and the environment will thank you. If you
								must drive, consider carpooling and do not speed as it uses more fuel which increases
								emission.</li>
							<li><b>Reduce CO2 emissions</b> – Everything we do creates emissions; Go camping instead of
								flying to an international destination; Make gifts instead of buying them; Repair broken
								items instead of replacing them with new ones. All these can really reduce your carbon
								footprint.</li>
							<li><b>Plant a tree</b> – Trees breathe in CO2 and turn it into oxygen; By planting trees,
								you help suck more CO2 out of the atmosphere.</li>
							<li><b>Eat less beef</b> – Meat, especially lamb and beef, has a large carbon footprint
								because of the high greenhouse gas emissions associated with rearing, processing,
								transporting, storing, and cooking animal products; A vegetarian diet has half the
								carbon footprint of a meat eater’s diet; Becoming vegetarian or eating less beef will
								reduce your carbon footprint. </li>
						</ul>

								<span class="w3-large">What is Global Warming?</span><br />
								<span>Global warming is the term used to describe the rising of the
									average global temperature of the Earth that started in the
									pre-Industrial era due to the heating of the Earth’s surface.
									The Earth’s warming trend has been going on for a very long
									time, but the rate of warming has significantly increased in the
									last century mainly due to human activities. Human activities
									such as burning of fossil fuels to generate power and
									manufacture goods are causing worldwide temperatures to rise
									higher and faster than any time we know of in the past.</span></a>

								<span class="w3-large">Causes OF Global Warming</span><br />
								<span>The main factor contributing to climate change is human
									activities. This is because of the large number of greenhouse
									gases we produce due to our lifestyle choices. Some greenhouse
									gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and play a part in
									making our planet habitable. However, the large number of
									greenhouse gases we produce is too much for the environment to
									handle.</span></a>

									style="width: 50px" />
								<span class="w3-large">Effects of Global Warming</span><br />
								<span>Warmer temperatures are gradually changing weather patterns and
									disrupting the normal balance of nature. Some of these changes
									such as heat waves, wildfires, prolonged drought, and extreme
									rainfall are happening faster than scientists previously
									predicted resulting in loss of lives, property damage and
									population displacement. Extreme weather and climate change pose
									many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.</span></a>

									style="width: 50px" />
								<span class="w3-large">Why should we care?</span><br />
								<span>Although climate change is affecting everyone, the concern is
									its effects on future generations especially children and young
									people in Africa who will most likely bear the brunt in the
									coming decades. Scientists estimate that the worst is yet to
									come and predict a warmer atmosphere and ocean if we do not
									reduce emissions. If global warming is not stopped or slowed
									down now, world economies could become stagnant as governments
									and investors divert funding from critical services such as
									health, education, nutrition, and other social services which
									would yield benefits for future generations to mitigate the
									climate crisis.</span></a>
