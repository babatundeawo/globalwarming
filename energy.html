          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>
              There has been a lot of debate, but the science is crystal clear: Emissions need to be reduced significantly to avoid
              the worst impacts of climate change. To be able to achieve this, the world must end our dependence on fossil fuels and
              start to use alternative sources of energy that are cleaner, accessible, affordable, reliable, and sustainable. Green
              and renewable energy sources are sustainable energy options to replace fossil fuels. Though green energy and renewable
              energy are used synonymously, there is a basic difference between them. Renewable energy is energy generated from
              infinite sources; Green energy is energy generated from infinite sources that does not produce carbon emissions or
              negatively impact the environment.
            </p>
            <p>While most green energy sources are renewable, not all renewable energy sources are considered entirely green. For
            example, the industrialisation and deforestation involved in the process of building large hydro dams (>30MW) used to
            generate energy from fast flowing water makes hydropower a renewable but not green resource. Another example of energy
            source that is renewable but not green is biomass. It is not green because the combustion of biomass materials (wood,
            agricultural crops, animal manure, and human sewage) releases carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulphur oxides into
            the atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Nuclear energy is an energy source that is neither green nor renewable. A large amount of energy is released in nuclear
            fission when electromagnetic radiation is used to split the nucleus of a uranium atom (U-235). Though the process does
            not produce greenhouse gas emissions, it requires mining, extraction, and long-term storage of radioactive waste which
            are threats to the environment.</p>
            <p>The perfect clean energy mix occurs where green energy meets renewable energy, such as with solar energy and wind
            energy.</p>

            <h3><b>HOW DOES IT WORK?</b></h3>
          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>
              Clean energy is produced using naturally replenished and virtually inexhaustible sources like the sun and wind. It works
              by producing power without negative environmental impacts, such as the release of greenhouse gases like CO2 which causes
              climate change. Fully developed, clean energy drives advances to preserve and protect the environment for future
              generations. A lot of clean energy is also renewable, including wind power, solar powered energy generation, and small
              hydro resources.</p>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <h3><b>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</b></h3>
          </div>

          <div class="w3-container">
            <p>
              Our world runs on the energy we produce. Production of clean energy helps to reduce the impact of climate change because
              it allows us to generate the energy the world needs without the greenhouse gas emissions and negative environmental
              effects that come with fossil fuels. While clean, renewable sources preserve the world’s natural resources, they also
              reduce the risk of environmental disasters, such as fuel spills or natural gas leaks. It is possible to create reliable
              power supplies with fuel diversification, using different energy sources. This will enhance energy security, ensuring
              there is enough affordable and reliable energy to meet our demands.</p>

            <p>
              Everybody has a role to place in reducing the effects of climate change and create a cleaner energy future for the
              generation to come. We can work together to lower our carbon footprint by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases we put
              into the atmosphere. This means using less energy! We can:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Take the bus, ride a bike, or carpool.</li>
              <li>Turn off lights and electronics when not using them.</li>
              <li>Recycle and reuse products, since making new stuff requires more energy.</li>
              <li>Plant a tree. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the air.</li>
              <li>Encourage communities and governments to switch to "clean" energy sources like solar , wind , nuclear
                , and
                geothermal power.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Climate change effects are being felt at all levels – local, national, and global. Becoming a Climate Ambassador will
              give the opportunity and platform to do something positive within your community and network.
            </p>
            <P>Greta Thunberg is probably the most famous Climate Activist/Ambassador. She is known around the world for protesting the
            Swedish government by sitting outside the parliament every day during school hours in August 2018 demanding that carbon
            emissions be reduced in accordance with the Paris Agreement. She was 15 years old. Her action inspired a youth-led
            global climate strike movement. Another Climate Activist is Vanessa Nakate. She became a well-known face in a global
            movement of young people “striking” for the climate protesting on the streets of Uganda in 2019. She was appointed
            UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2022.</P>
            <p>As a Climate Ambassador, you will lead the way by:
              <ul>
                <li>Taking climate change discussions into your schools and local communities across Africa and by extension the world</li>
                <li>Creating climate-focused clubs and groups to promote eco-education in schools</li>
                <li>Mentoring younger students to become environmental stewards as they take on climate issues in their communities</li>
                <li>Organising earth-friendly projects</li>
              </ul>

            <p>As we take on this life changing role to be a Climate Ambassador, we must be very intentional about our lifestyle
            choices and purchasing habits to reduce our carbon footprint. It is important, now more than ever, that we join hands
            together as children to educate others about climate change.</p>

                <span class="w3-large">What is Global Warming?</span><br />
                <span>Global warming is the term used to describe the rising of the
                  average global temperature of the Earth that started in the
                  pre-Industrial era due to the heating of the Earth’s surface.
                  The Earth’s warming trend has been going on for a very long
                  time, but the rate of warming has significantly increased in the
                  last century mainly due to human activities. Human activities
                  such as burning of fossil fuels to generate power and
                  manufacture goods are causing worldwide temperatures to rise
                  higher and faster than any time we know of in the past.</span></a>

                <span class="w3-large">Causes OF Global Warming</span><br />
                <span>The main factor contributing to climate change is human
                  activities. This is because of the large number of greenhouse
                  gases we produce due to our lifestyle choices. Some greenhouse
                  gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and play a part in
                  making our planet habitable. However, the large number of
                  greenhouse gases we produce is too much for the environment to
                  handle.</span></a>

                <span>Warmer temperatures are gradually changing weather patterns and
                  disrupting the normal balance of nature. Some of these changes
                  such as heat waves, wildfires, prolonged drought, and extreme
                  rainfall are happening faster than scientists previously
                  predicted resulting in loss of lives, property damage and
                  population displacement. Extreme weather and climate change pose
                  many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.</span></a>

                <span>Although climate change is affecting everyone, the concern is
                  its effects on future generations especially children and young
                  people in Africa who will most likely bear the brunt in the
                  coming decades. Scientists estimate that the worst is yet to
                  come and predict a warmer atmosphere and ocean if we do not
                  reduce emissions. If global warming is not stopped or slowed
                  down now, world economies could become stagnant as governments
                  and investors divert funding from critical services such as
                  health, education, nutrition, and other social services which
                  would yield benefits for future generations to mitigate the
                  climate crisis.</span></a>
