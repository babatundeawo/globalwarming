						<h3><b>REDUCE REUSE RECYCLE</b></h3>
					</div>

					<div class="w3-container">
						<p>
							Everything we produce, buy, or use affects the environment. This
							environmental impact could be positive or negative.
							Unfortunately, most of the products we use negatively impact the
							environment through their production and usage and could harm
							the environment even further through improper disposal. For
							example, some of the products we use are made from plastics
							(takes between 20 - 500 years to decompose depending on
							structure) which often ends up in the landfill where they are
							burnt releasing CO2 to the atmosphere or ends up in our oceans
							negatively impacting sea life. We need to think about the
							environmental impact of the products we use and buy less of
							those that have a high negative impact. One way to think about
							the things we use is to look at the 3 Rs of managing waste:
							REDUCE, REUSE, RECYLE.
						</p>
						<img src="images/giphy (6).gif" alt="Nature" style="width: 100%" />
						<p>
							<b>REDUCE: Cut back on the amount of waste you generate.</b><br>
							It’s the first of the 3 Rs because it’s the best method for
							keeping the environment clean. By reducing, you stop the problem
							at the source because making less waste to start with means
							there’s less waste to dispose. Simple ways you can reduce the
							amount of waste you make:
						<ul>
							<li>Only buy things when you really need them e.g., If your trainers still fit, you do not
								need to buy a new pair. </li>
							<li>Use a lunchbox to pack your lunch instead of using paper or plastic bags which end up
								creating a huge amount of waste</li>
							<li>Say “No” to single-use plastics which end up in landfills and the ocean e.g., Use a
								reusable water bottle instead of buying bottled water.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<img src="images/giphy (7).gif" alt="Nature" style="width: 100%" />
						<p>
							<b>REUSE: Find new ways to use old things.</b><br>
							The second of the 3 Rs. Reusing is taking old or unwanted items you might otherwise throw
							away and finding a new use for them. This saves time and money as well as energy and
							materials. Easy ways to reuse items:
						<ul>
							<li>Share your toys and if you no longer need them, donate them to an orphanage or local
								daycare.</li>
							<li>Find new use for old items e.g., Fill old food jars with leftovers; Use library books
								which are reused instead of buying a new book that will only be read once; Keep wrapping
								paper from old presents and use again; Use an old toothbrush as hairbrush.</li>
							<li>Have a garage sale to clean out your space and help reuse all the items you don’t want
								because there’s someone out there who would love to have them, and you can make a little
								money too.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>RECYCLE: Change discarded materials into new products. </b><br>
							Recycling, the last of the 3 Rs is turning something old and useless into something new and
							useful to avoid using more virgin resources. This is important for reducing the amount of
							trash in landfills which if left unattended can become dangerous through the chemicals and
							gases they release. Animals will sometimes eat this trash which causes problems in the
							ecosystems.
							Recycling also preserves natural resources used to make products, like trees used to make
							paper – when we recycle and reuse paper, we no longer need to cut down trees. While
							recycling is a way to extend the lifespan of a material, it still requires resources and
							energy. Some examples of recycling:
						<ul>
							<li>Cardboard is recycled into new cardboard, paper bags, and paperboard boxes for
								detergent, cereal etc.</li>
							<li>Plastics is turned into plastic lumber for buckets, storage tubs, plastic bottles etc.
							</li>
							<li>Newspaper is probably the most-recycled material. They gets turned into egg cartons,
								building insulation, paper plates, construction paper, and new newspaper.</li>
							<li>Aluminum cans can be reprocessed into new cans, bike frames and asphalt roadway.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<p>A notable model of recycling is the women of the Ilaje community. Being recently sensitized
							to proper ways to dispose of waste, they are now cleaning up their communities while making
							money for themselves by selling plastics. Click here to <a

								<span class="w3-large">What is Global Warming?</span><br />
								<span>Global warming is the term used to describe the rising of the
									average global temperature of the Earth that started in the
									pre-Industrial era due to the heating of the Earth’s surface.
									The Earth’s warming trend has been going on for a very long
									time, but the rate of warming has significantly increased in the
									last century mainly due to human activities. Human activities
									such as burning of fossil fuels to generate power and
									manufacture goods are causing worldwide temperatures to rise
									higher and faster than any time we know of in the past.</span></a>

									style="width: 50px" />
								<span class="w3-large">Causes OF Global Warming</span><br />
								<span>The main factor contributing to climate change is human
									activities. This is because of the large number of greenhouse
									gases we produce due to our lifestyle choices. Some greenhouse
									gases occur naturally in the atmosphere and play a part in
									making our planet habitable. However, the large number of
									greenhouse gases we produce is too much for the environment to
									handle.</span></a>

									style="width: 50px" />
								<span class="w3-large">Effects of Global Warming</span><br />
								<span>Warmer temperatures are gradually changing weather patterns and
									disrupting the normal balance of nature. Some of these changes
									such as heat waves, wildfires, prolonged drought, and extreme
									rainfall are happening faster than scientists previously
									predicted resulting in loss of lives, property damage and
									population displacement. Extreme weather and climate change pose
									many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on Earth.</span></a>

								<img src="images/picture8.png" alt="Image" class="w3-left w3-margin-right"
									style="width: 50px" />
								<span class="w3-large">Why should we care?</span><br />
								<span>Although climate change is affecting everyone, the concern is
									its effects on future generations especially children and young
									people in Africa who will most likely bear the brunt in the
									coming decades. Scientists estimate that the worst is yet to
									come and predict a warmer atmosphere and ocean if we do not
									reduce emissions. If global warming is not stopped or slowed
									down now, world economies could become stagnant as governments
									and investors divert funding from critical services such as
									health, education, nutrition, and other social services which
									would yield benefits for future generations to mitigate the
									climate crisis.</span></a>
