  var QUESTIONS = [
    {
      q: "What is the main job of greenhouse gases like CO2 in our atmosphere?",
      options: ["They block all sunlight from reaching Earth", "They trap heat that would otherwise escape to space", "They create the wind", "They make the sky blue"],
      correct: 1,
      explain: "Greenhouse gases let sunlight in but trap some of the heat that Earth's surface radiates back out — like a blanket around the planet."
    },
    {
      q: "About how much has atmospheric CO2 risen since before the Industrial Revolution (around 1750-1800)?",
      options: ["About 5% higher", "About 50% higher", "It hasn't changed", "It's actually lower now"],
      correct: 1,
      explain: "Pre-industrial CO2 was about 280 parts per million (ppm). By 2025 the global average was around 427 ppm — roughly 50% higher."
    },
    {
      q: "Which of these is the LARGEST human source of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide?",
      options: ["Burning fossil fuels for electricity, heat and transport", "Cows burping", "Volcanoes", "Recycling plastic"],
      correct: 0,
      explain: "Burning coal, oil and gas for energy and transport is by far the largest source — agriculture and land-use change are significant too, but smaller."
    },
    {
      q: "Which Nigerian state was hit by some of the country's worst flash floods on record in 2025?",
      options: ["Niger State (Mokwa)", "Cross River", "Ekiti", "Nasarawa"],
      correct: 0,
      explain: "Heavy rainfall and a dam-related surge caused devastating flooding in Mokwa, Niger State, in May 2025 — officials called it the worst in decades for the area."
    },
    {
      q: "What does 'renewable energy' mean?",
      options: ["Energy that never runs out, like sunlight and wind", "Energy you can use only once", "Energy made only from oil", "Energy that costs nothing to build"],
      correct: 0,
      explain: "Renewable energy comes from sources that naturally replenish — sunlight, wind, flowing water, and so on — instead of being dug up and burned."
    },
    {
      q: "Roughly what share of the world's electricity came from renewable sources in 2025?",
      options: ["About 1%", "About one third (34%)", "About 90%", "Exactly half"],
      correct: 1,
      explain: "Renewables reached about 34% of global electricity generation in 2025, up from roughly 23% just a decade earlier — fast growth, but still room to go."
    },
    {
      q: "Why does recycling a can or bottle usually produce fewer emissions than making a new one?",
      options: ["It doesn't — recycling uses more energy", "Processing used material generally takes less energy than mining and refining raw material", "Recycled items are smaller", "It only matters for paper"],
      correct: 1,
      explain: "Turning used aluminium, glass or paper back into new products usually takes much less energy than starting from raw ore, sand or trees."
    },
    {
      q: "What's a simple definition of someone's 'carbon footprint'?",
      options: ["The size of shoe they wear", "The total greenhouse gases caused by their activities and lifestyle", "How many trees they've planted", "Their height"],
      correct: 1,
      explain: "A carbon footprint adds up the greenhouse gas emissions linked to things like travel, electricity use, and diet — usually measured in tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year."
    },
    {
      q: "Which of these actions has the biggest day-to-day impact on most people's personal footprint?",
      options: ["Turning off one light switch once", "Reducing car travel, flights, and energy waste", "Buying a new phone case", "Using a paper straw instead of plastic"],
      correct: 1,
      explain: "Transport and energy use tend to dominate a personal footprint far more than small single actions — though every habit adds up."
    },
    {
      q: "Why do scientists say Africa is especially vulnerable to climate change, even though it has produced a small share of historic global emissions?",
      options: ["Africa has no rivers", "Many African economies depend heavily on farming, fishing and rainfall patterns that climate change disrupts", "It never rains in Africa", "Climate change only affects cold countries"],
      correct: 1,
      explain: "Heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture, coastal cities, and limited infrastructure to absorb shocks make many African communities highly exposed to floods, drought and heat — despite contributing comparatively little to the emissions causing the problem."
